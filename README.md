# Green Zone Monitoring System

This repository contains the documentation and design artifacts for the *Green Zone Monitoring System* project, developed as part of the Software Design & Construction I course at university.

## Project Overview

The Green Zone Monitoring System is a conceptual software solution designed to manage and monitor vehicle access to a restricted urban area. The system enforces entry/exit control, billing, and violation handling based on permit status and vehicle behavior.

## Features

- Vehicle entry and exit tracking using barcode scanners and cameras
- Automatic fine issuance for unauthorized access
- Dynamic billing system based on time-of-day and vehicle type
- Asynchronous sensor communication and subsystem coordination
- Full software design using UML and modeling techniques

## Documentation

The full project design document (PDF) includes:
- Use Case Models
- Class Diagrams
- Statecharts
- Communication and Task Architecture Diagrams
